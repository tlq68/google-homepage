The google-homepage repository is an experiemental area to give me some idea of how to maneuver through Git and GitHub. 

There will be two parts to the project:
  1. Creating the google homepage.
  2. Creating a replica of the first results page after a search term is entered. 

After the projects are complete, the process will be retold here.
