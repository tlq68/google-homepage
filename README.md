# google-homepage

The google-homepage repository is an experiemental area to give me some idea of how to maneuver through Git and GitHub.

There will be two parts to the project:

1. Creating the google homepage.
2. Creating a replica of the first results page after a search term is entered.


The process for creating the google homepage:

First, the HTML structure was added. Starting with the navbar in the top right corner, then the logo and then the searchbar/buttons, etc. 
Then, the CSS styling process continued in a similar way. The icons and links were positioned using flex.
After this, the Google logo was centered along with the search bar. The search bar was created by placing an input field inside a div (this div would serve as the rounded search field that users will actually see); the outline was removed from the text input so that it looks like the div with the rounded edges is the input field. The div was placed inside a container div so that the display of the searchbar could be set to absolute. The icons were also added and positioned in this step. The magnifying glass icon is just linked to the text box, but the microphone is a link that will take you to the Google Speech-to-text website, just because.
Following the searchbar, the buttons were adjusted. 
The subsequent steps involved organization and adding the Apapche 2.0 copyright license and the stylesheet for Bootstrap 5. 
The final touches involved positioning the footers properly with Bootstrap, adding appropriate media queries and adding text-shadows to various elements for a nice effect.
